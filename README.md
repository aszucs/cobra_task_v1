# cobra_task_v1
Competitive Behavioral assessment of Rivalry and Admiration-seeking (CoBRA) task

## Short description:
The snake game is a social decision-making task designed to capture narcissistic reactions to defeat, using a computer game competition where the outcomes are rigged. Players are told they will play against previous participants whose performance has been pre-recorded and that in doing so, they will take part in the competition’s global ranking.
Striving for dominance is measured both on a one-to-one competitive level and on a global hierarchical level by 2 distinct outcome measures:
- **outcome measure 1 – point stealing (rivalry)**: at the beginning of each trial, participants can choose to steal points from their next opponent to increase their own chances of victory.
- **outcome measure 2 – rank buying (admiration-seeking)**: at the end of each trial, participants can pay for boosters that improve their rank in the competition’s global league table.

## Software requirements:
Please, note that this game is designed to work on PCs and Windows tablets, the code may need adaptations to run on Mac.
You need to have MATLAB (version 2013 or older) and Python (either version 2.7 or 3.5) installed.

## Installation:
•	Download the content of this repository and decompress the .zip file *cobra_task_V1.zip* in a location of your choice.
Warning: Do not put it in MATLAB’s folder; anywhere else is fine.

•	Open the *cobra_task_V1* folder.

•	Carefully read the user manual *cobra_task_v1_manual.pdf* before launching the task.

•	To run the task, open the file *main_game_launcher.m* with MATLAB (right click -> Open with -> MATLAB), and simply click “run” from the MATLAB editor window (green arrow in the upper menu).

•	Further instructions, troubleshooting tips and a codebook to measured variables can be found in the **user manual**.
